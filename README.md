#### Coding project for OOP CAS at ZHAW
The aim of our extension task is a memory game with which children can learn about different animals of the world. When starting the game, players can create a user profile or select an existing one. The current score of a player is saved in the user profile.  
Before starting the game, the players can choose between different game field sizes (difficulty levels).   

 

The players must try to uncover two animals of the same species on a playing field with face-down cards. If they succeed, the revealed animal appears with its name so that the children can learn the animals including their names.
